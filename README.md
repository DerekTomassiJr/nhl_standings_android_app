Currently app has bugs as this was demo to try and make an android from scratch using Jetpack Compose & an external API.

Some bugs that will addressed soon:
- Scrolling between Team Table and Standings Table is not locked together
- Games Playes and Points Percentage Stats are not currently accurate
- Seeing crashing after x amount of time
